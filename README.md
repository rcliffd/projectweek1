# Project-Week-1
Dream Team Project

Music Database App

In our app, you can listen to music, and get information on how to buy the artists’ albums. We also want to have a list of songs that the user can play, a link to purchase songs, as well as a biography of the artist and pictures. The site also shows the top 5 YouTube videos of the artist.
